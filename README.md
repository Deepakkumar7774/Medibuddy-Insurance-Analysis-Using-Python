# 🏥 MediBuddy Capstone Project – Data Analysis


## 📌 Project Overview

MediBuddy is a digital healthcare platform for an inpatient hospitalization, outpatient services, and corporate wellness benefits. MediBuddy is the award-winning technology platform from Medi Assist that transforms the health insurance industry at the very core. MediBuddy, with its diverse offerings for various stakeholders of the health benefits industry, makes the process of discovering, accessing, utilizing, and monitoring health benefits seamless, real-time, and virtually paperless. The company was founded in 2000 and based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India.
In the assignment below, there are two datasets, one having the age and BMI(Body Mass Index) that is received from a pre health checkup before the policy cover; and the other dataset includes some personal details such as the no. of children, whether the person smokes or not, the location where the person is from etc. 

MediBuddy is a digital healthcare platform that provides **inpatient hospitalization, outpatient services, and corporate wellness benefits**. 
It aims to make health benefits **seamless, real-time, and paperless**.

This project involves **analyzing two datasets** related to health insurance claims and policyholders to derive insights that can assist in decision-making.



## 📂 Dataset Information

We have **two datasets**:
1. **Pre-health checkup data**: Includes **age** and **BMI (Body Mass Index)** before policy cover.
2. **Personal details data**: Contains **number of dependents**, **smoking status**, **geographic location**, and more.



## 🔍 Analysis Goals

This project aims to answer the following key questions using **Python-based analysis**:

1️⃣ **Does gender impact policy extension?**  
2️⃣ **What is the average amount spent per policy cover?**  
3️⃣ **Should the company offer different policies based on location?**  
4️⃣ **Does the number of dependents affect the claim amount?**  
5️⃣ **Can BMI predict the insurance claim amount?**  
6️⃣ **Should the company consider smoking status for policy decisions?**  
7️⃣ **Does age create a barrier for claims?**  
8️⃣ **Can BMI be used to extend discounts?**  

Each of these questions is explored using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, and visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn**.



**⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used**

✅ Python for data analysis
✅ Pandas & NumPy for data cleaning & statistical calculations
✅ Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization
✅ Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis



## 📊 Python-Based Analysis

### **Techniques Used:**

✔ **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Handling missing values and formatting data.  
✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying trends and patterns.  
✔ **Statistical Insights** – Using correlation analysis and visualization.  


### **Key Findings:**

📌 **Gender & Policy Extension:** No significant difference in claim approvals between genders.  
📌 **Average Money Spent:** The average claim amount per policy cover was analyzed.  
📌 **Geographic Impact:** Some locations had higher claims, suggesting region-based policy customization.  
📌 **Dependents & Claims:** More dependents correlated with higher claim amounts.  
📌 **BMI & Claims:** Higher BMI led to increased insurance claims, supporting risk-based pricing.  
📌 **Smoking & Coverage:** Smokers generally had **higher claim amounts** due to health risks.  
📌 **Age Barrier:** Older policyholders had higher claim amounts, requiring age-based policy adjustments.  
📌 **Discount Strategy:** Lower BMI individuals could be considered for premium discounts.

## 📊 Key Insights from Data Analysis

### **1️⃣ Gender & Policy Extension**
🔹 **Insight:** There is no significant difference between male and female policyholders in terms of claim approvals.  
🔹 **Action:** The company should **not use gender as a constraint** in extending policies.  

### **2️⃣ Average Amount Spent per Policy Cover**
🔹 **Insight:** The average claim amount varies based on factors like **age, BMI, and smoking status**.  
🔹 **Action:** Adjust premium calculations based on individual risk profiles rather than a flat-rate policy.  

### **3️⃣ Impact of Geographic Location on Policies**
🔹 **Insight:** Certain locations had **higher claim rates** than others, possibly due to regional health risks or medical costs.  
🔹 **Action:** The company may consider **location-based risk adjustments** for pricing policies.  

### **4️⃣ Dependents & Insurance Claims**
🔹 **Insight:** A higher number of dependents **increased the claim amount**.  
🔹 **Action:** Introduce **family plans** with different pricing for policyholders with dependents.  

### **5️⃣ BMI & Insurance Claims**
🔹 **Insight:** Individuals with a **higher BMI** generally **claimed more insurance** due to higher health risks.  
🔹 **Action:** Consider **BMI-based risk adjustments** in policy pricing.  

### **6️⃣ Smoking & Insurance Coverage**
🔹 **Insight:** **Smokers had significantly higher claims** compared to non-smokers.  
🔹 **Action:** The company should **differentiate policies** for smokers and offer higher premiums for high-risk individuals.  

### **7️⃣ Age & Claim Amount**
🔹 **Insight:** **Older individuals** tend to have **higher claims** due to age-related medical conditions.  
🔹 **Action:** Consider **age-based policy structures** to balance risk and affordability.  

### **8️⃣ BMI & Discounts**
🔹 **Insight:** Policyholders with a **healthy BMI** have **lower claim amounts**, indicating better health.  
🔹 **Action:** The company could **offer premium discounts** for policyholders with a lower BMI as an incentive.

**💡 Business Impact & Recommendations**


🔹 Risk-Based Premium Pricing – Adjust premiums based on factors like BMI, smoking status, and location.
🔹 Geographic Policy Customization – Offer region-specific pricing based on claim patterns.
🔹 Health-Based Discounts – Incentivize customers with healthy BMIs and non-smoking habits.
🔹 Senior Citizen Plans – Introduce specialized policies for elderly policyholders.

By leveraging data analytics, insurance companies can create better, fairer policies while maintaining profitability and risk control.



**📢 Conclusion**


This project provides valuable insights into insurance policy decision-making using Python-based data analysis. The findings suggest that factors like BMI, smoking status, age, and location significantly impact claims and should be considered in pricing and policy structuring.
