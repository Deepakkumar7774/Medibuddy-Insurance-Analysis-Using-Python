# 🏥 MediBuddy Capstone Project – Data Analysis


## 📌 Project Overview

MediBuddy is a digital healthcare platform for an inpatient hospitalization, outpatient services, and corporate wellness benefits. MediBuddy is the award-winning technology platform from Medi Assist that transforms the health insurance industry at the very core. MediBuddy, with its diverse offerings for various stakeholders of the health benefits industry, makes the process of discovering, accessing, utilizing, and monitoring health benefits seamless, real-time, and virtually paperless. The company was founded in 2000 and based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India.
In the assignment below, there are two datasets, one having the age and BMI(Body Mass Index) that is received from a pre health checkup before the policy cover; and the other dataset includes some personal details such as the no. of children, whether the person smokes or not, the location where the person is from etc. 
MediBuddy is a digital healthcare platform that provides **inpatient hospitalization, outpatient services, and corporate wellness benefits**. It aims to make health benefits **seamless, real-time, and paperless**.

This project involves **analyzing two datasets** related to health insurance claims and policyholders to derive insights that can assist in decision-making.



## 📂 Dataset Information

We have **two datasets**:
1. **Pre-health checkup data**: Includes **age** and **BMI (Body Mass Index)** before policy cover.
2. **Personal details data**: Contains **number of dependents**, **smoking status**, **geographic location**, and more.



## 🔍 Analysis Goals

This project aims to answer the following key questions using **Python-based analysis**:

1️⃣ **Does gender impact policy extension?**  
2️⃣ **What is the average amount spent per policy cover?**  
3️⃣ **Should the company offer different policies based on location?**  
4️⃣ **Does the number of dependents affect the claim amount?**  
5️⃣ **Can BMI predict the insurance claim amount?**  
6️⃣ **Should the company consider smoking status for policy decisions?**  
7️⃣ **Does age create a barrier for claims?**  
8️⃣ **Can BMI be used to extend discounts?**  

Each of these questions is explored using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, and visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn**.


## 📊 Python-Based Analysis
### **Techniques Used:**
✔ **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Handling missing values and formatting data.  
✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying trends and patterns.  
✔ **Statistical Insights** – Using correlation analysis and visualization.  


### **Key Findings:**

📌 **Gender & Policy Extension:** No significant difference in claim approvals between genders.  
📌 **Average Money Spent:** The average claim amount per policy cover was analyzed.  
📌 **Geographic Impact:** Some locations had higher claims, suggesting region-based policy customization.  
📌 **Dependents & Claims:** More dependents correlated with higher claim amounts.  
📌 **BMI & Claims:** Higher BMI led to increased insurance claims, supporting risk-based pricing.  
📌 **Smoking & Coverage:** Smokers generally had **higher claim amounts** due to health risks.  
📌 **Age Barrier:** Older policyholders had higher claim amounts, requiring age-based policy adjustments.  
📌 **Discount Strategy:** Lower BMI individuals could be considered for premium discounts.
